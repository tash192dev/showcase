My final-year [research project](https://part4project.foe.auckland.ac.nz/home/project/detail/5573) focuses on designing a hardware accelerator to improve the performance and efficiency of [TinyML](https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/tinyml) applications running on softcore processors deployed on FPGAs. The project targets resource-constrained AIoT use cases where low-latency inference and energy efficiency are critical.

An Intel Arria 10 FPGA is used as the development platform, with Nios V selected as the softcore processor due to its robust toolchain support and readily available compilers. Hardware development is carried out in Intel Quartus Prime, with Platform Designer used for system-level hardware integration. TinyML benchmarks are implemented and evaluated using the Ashling RiscFree IDE to assess the acceleratorâ€™s impact on execution time and computational efficiency.
