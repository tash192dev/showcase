Designed and built a line-following robot powered by a PSoC 5LP Arm SoC, capable of navigating a projected maze using onboard light sensors.

Used oscilloscope and FFT analysis to fine-tune the analog signal path, informing both hardware and firmware design. Developed a custom PCB in Altium with optimized sensor placement for reliable line detection. Implemented maze solving and line-following logic in C, using a PI control loop with rotary encoder feedback for precise motion. Motors were driven via PWM, with wireless debugging integrated to streamline development and testing.
